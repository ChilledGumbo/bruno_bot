Does anyone feel bad for our class this year? Why can you talk about sensitive topics like dick and penis in a group chat with a bunch of stranger you never met? Even if you guys are all social and friendly to every one, is that fine to discus about sex and dick like that with others? Imagine your siblings or girlfriend/boyfriend do the same thing, how would you feel? You're welcome to let them do that? I feel bad for you guys. This is honest, learn to set up boundaries.

It has long been recognized that taller adults hold jobs of higher status and, on average, earn more than other workers. A large number of hypotheses have been put forward to explain the association between height and earnings. In developed countries, researchers have emphasized factors such as self esteem, social dominance, and discrimination. In this paper, we offer a simpler explanation: On average, taller people earn more because they are smarter. As early as age 3 before schooling has had a chance to play a role and throughout childhood, taller children perform significantly better on cognitive tests. The correlation between height in childhood and adulthood is approximately 0.7 for both men and women, so that tall children are much more likely to become tall adults. As adults, taller individuals are more likely to select into higher paying occupations that require more advanced verbal and numerical skills and greater intelligence, for which they earn handsome returns. Using four data sets from the US and the UK, we find that the height premium in adult earnings can be explained by childhood scores on cognitive tests. Furthermore, we show that taller adults select into occupations that have higher cognitive skill requirements and lower physical skill demands.
